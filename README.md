Following the Q learning basics.I tried to create a QLearningEnvironment that replicates a very simple pacman

Teal light blue is the agent.
Red is enemy
Green is Food

Learning rate without moving food + enemy = 1 minute
learning rate with moving food + enemy = 3 minute

Next step could be creating pacman.
